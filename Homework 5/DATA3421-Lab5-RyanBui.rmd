Problem A1: 1. Load the iris dataset into R and explore its structure
and summary statistics.

```{r iris}
summary(iris)
```

## Problem A2:

Create a scatterplot of the sepal length and width of the iris flowers.
Use different colors to represent the different species of flowers.

```{r iris, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of Sepal Width vs Sepal Length",
       x = "Sepal Width", y = "Sepal Length")
```

## Problem A3

Create a boxplot of the petal length for each species of flower.

```{r iris, echo=FALSE}
# Sub-setting the iris dataset into each species of flower
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Sepal Width by Species",
       x = "Species", y = "Sepal Length")
```

## Problem A4

Create a histogram of the sepal width of the iris flowers.

```{r iris, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_histogram(fill="lightblue", color="black", binwidth=0.2) +
  labs(title="Histogram of Sepal Width", x="Sepal Width", y="Frequency")
```

## Problem B1

Load the mtcars dataset into R and explore its structure and summary
statistics.

```{r mtcars, echo=FALSE}
summary(mtcars)
```

## Problem B2

Use linear regression to model the relationship between "mpg" (dependent
variable) and "hp" (Independent variable). Interpret the regression
coefficients and R-squared value.

```{r mtcars, echo=FALSE}
# Create a scatter plot of mpg vs. hp
model <- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)
# Print the model summary
summary(model)
```

```{r mtcars, echo=FALSE}
# Add the regression line to the scatter plot
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Horsepower", y = "Miles per Gallon") +
  ggtitle("Scatter plot of mpg vs. hp with regression line") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

The adjusted R-Squared value is 0.5892 which means that about 59% of the
variance in the response variable is explained by our independent
variable which is horsepower. Looking at the coefficient of horsepower
we can see that it looks like that for every point of horsepower you
lose 0.0068 miles per gallon. \## Problem B3 Create a multiple linear
regression model (using "hp" and "wt" as Independent variables, and mpg
as a dependent variable).

```{r mtcars, echo=FALSE}
model <- lm(mpg ~ hp + wt, data = mtcars)
summary(model)
```

```{r mtcars, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Mileage vs. Weight+Horsepower", x = "Weight and Horsepower", y = "Miles Per Gallon")
```

## Problem B4

Compare the predictive power of the simple linear regression model
(using "hp" as the predictor variable) and the multiple linear
regression model (using "hp" and "wt" as predictor variables).

Comparing the adjusted R-squared values the multiple linear regression
model has the higher value with 0.8148 compared to the simple linear
regression model which has 0.5892. So the multiple linear regression
model can explain 81% of the variance in the dependent variable.

The horsepower coefficient seems to have gotten slightly larger from the
original model it is not -0.03 where as before it was -0.006. It could
be noted that the weight coefficient much larger than the other ones so
one could infer that weight has a larger impact on the miles per gallon
of the vehicle.
